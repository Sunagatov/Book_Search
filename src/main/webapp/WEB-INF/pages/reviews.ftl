                Today, divorce has become a very common part of life, and it is likely that ineffective communication
                plays a crucial role in the failure of many marriages. Communication may lead to the success of a
                marriage or to its detriment, depending on its level
                of effectiveness. This effectiveness of communication is likely connected to the overall satisfaction of
                married couples and is worthy to be studied in order to increase marital satisfaction. Learning more
                about the differences in communication
                styles between men and women will aid in the more successful sending and receiving of messages, both
                verbal and nonverbal. For example, a woman may communicate in a way that has meaning to her. However,
                the man receiving the message may interpret
                it differently than she intended due to their differences in communication style. This can cause
                conflict and lead to further problems in the relationship. However, if the man decoding the message were
                familiar with his wife’s style of communication,
                he may have interpreted it properly therefore avoiding a conflict situation. The reverse, when men are
                communicating to women, is also true. Husbands and wives are interdependent, and their level of
                commitment and desire to maintain a healthy
                relationship often depends on the other person (Weigel & Ballard-Reisch, 2008). Conventional wisdom says
                that there is no such thing as lack of communication. A person always communicates something, whether
                intentional or not. Becoming more
                aware of how one’s own self communicates will also aid in more healthy communication between spouses.
                This literature review will discuss nonverbal communication styles, including flirtation, and conflict
                communication, including communicated
                perspective-taking. This study will further advance communication research by helping people discover
                more about their personal communication styles as men and women and by helping them communicate more
                effectively with their partners. In a
                culture where marriage is considered a risk, it is crucial to conduct studies that will help further the
                knowledge on how to have a successful marriage.
